      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently going through the Monash University Coding Bootcamp to
        become a Full Stack Developer. I am originally from Colombia and
        currently living in Melbourne, Australia. My career background is in
        Hospitality where I have worked in management positions with worldwide
        hotel chains that had helped me to develop a vast range of soft skills
        that can be applied in any industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passions are: music, I enjoy playing piano and guitar, writing my own
        songs and having jamming sessions with my mates; cooking with my partner
        and friends, I used to be a chef back in Colombia and travel to discover
        new places and learn from other cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am looking for new opportunities to start my career as web
        developer I invite you to check on my portfolio that I am working on and
        I look forward to connect with you.
