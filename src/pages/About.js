          Currently looking for opportunities within Software Development, which
          match my new and developing skills that I have gained from my studies
          with Monash University Coding Bootcamp. Through more than 6 years
          working in the hotel industry in the areas of Distribution (Data)
          Services, Learning & Development, and Customer Service I have
          developed strong leadership, adaptability, problem solving, and
          communication skills that are transferable and, I believe, gives huge
          value within the IT industry.
